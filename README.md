# Probabilistic models of scRNA-seq
Package to reproduce results in my MSc Thesis.


### Requirements
See `requirements.txt`.
 
R needs to be installed with [ZINB-WaVE](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/zinbwave.html) and [pCMF](https://gitlab.inria.fr/gdurif/pCMF) packages.

See `data/README.md` for information about data sets.


### Acknowledgements
The code to run ZIFA, ZINB-WaVE and scVI was partly adapted from [scVI-reproducibility](https://github.com/romain-lopez/scVI-reproducibility).
